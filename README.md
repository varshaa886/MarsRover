Mars Rover Design with Robotic Arm

A Mars Rover design with a highly functional robotic arm, created using Autodesk Fusion 360. Ideal for academic research, simulations, and prototyping, featuring a robust chassis.
Overview
This repository contains a Mars Rover design created using Autodesk Fusion 360. The rover features a highly functional robotic arm for drilling, collecting, and storing samples, making it ideal for academic research, simulations, and prototyping.

Features
Robotic Arm: Capable of drilling, collecting, and storing Martian samples.
6-Wheel Drive: Designed for navigating rough terrain.
Solar Panels: Provide sustainable power for the rover.
High-Definition Camera: Attached for navigation and scientific observation.
Sensor Space: Allocated areas for weather sensors.
Dust Propeller: Prevents dust accumulation on critical components.

Robotic Arm:
The robotic arm, affixed to the front face of the rover, is a critical component for conducting scientific experiments and sample collection. It comprises four main parts:

1. Base Part: Fixed to the face of the main body, this component allows rotation in one plane (plane â€“ A say) (180 degrees), providing the arm with a wide range of motion.

2. Main Skeleton(link): Consisting of three parallel cylinders fixed to two similar surfaces, this part is joined to the other link as the arm's elbow, enabling perpendicular (perpendicular to plane A) revolutions to the base part (with a constraint of 250 degrees to avoid obstruction from the rover's body). IT can also revolute in its plane.

3. Flexibility Part(link): Enhancing the arm's degree of freedom, this component allows additional rotations, although with certain constraints to prevent interference with other components.

4. End Effector: The fourth part comprises two subparts - a drill cone for efficient drilling operations and a sample collector scooper(the scooper is designed such that it is closed on 4 sides to prevent the samples to fall down when the wind gets stronger). Both subparts are designed for ease of operation, with threaded features for drilling and sliding mechanisms for sample collection.
